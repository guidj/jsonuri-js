# JSONURI-JS [NEEDS-TO-BE-UPDATED]

The originial design has been changed in [jsonuri-py](https://github.com/guidj/jsonuri-py). Now, instead of this custom serialization, we just turn the JSON to a string, compress it using Gzip, and encoded it as Base64 before applying HTTP escaping for transfer as an HTTP parameter value. This JS version does not yet reflect this

This script helps you convert a JSON/JavaScript object into an HTTP GET request parameters. The reverse is also possible, i.e. convert HTTP GET request parameters into a JSON/JavaScript object.

An example of a practical application would be to send JSON data over HTTP GET, e.g. to a static resource small.png, and harvest the data from access logs instead of running real-time data collection.

The library is written is TypeScript. You need only to compile it to JavaScript and minify it to deploy.

**Note**: You should avoid send sensitive information using this mechanism, or at least ensure you send your data over SSL.

## Usage

### Test Data
```JavaScript
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 31,
    "profile": "http://profiles/professionals/who.cgi?id=269260&full=yes",
    "schools": [
        "School A & B", "School B & D", "School C &amp; AFG"
    ],
    "friends": [
        {
            "name": "Mary",
            "age": 27
        },{
            "name": "Susan",
            "age": 35
        }
    ],
    "family": {
        "parents": [
            {
                "relation": "father",
                "name": "Doe"
            },
            {
                "relation": "mother",
                "name": "Jane"
            }
        ],
        "siblings": [
            {
                "sister1": {
                    "name": "Ana",
                    "age": 26,
                    "children":[
                        "Eric", "Lane"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### JS
```JavaScript
> var mappedString = mapJSONToUriParams(testData); //get non-encoded string
```

```URL
> console.log(mappedString);
name=John&age=31&schools[0]=School A&schools[1]=School B&schools[2]=School C&friends[0]name=Mary&friends[0]age=27&friends[1]name=Susan&friends[1]age=35&family:parents[0]relation=father&family:parents[0]name=Doe&family:parents[1]relation=mother&family:parents[1]name=Jane&family:siblings[0]sister1:name=Ana&family:siblings[0]sister1:age=26&family:siblings[0]sister1:children[0]=Eric&family:siblings[0]sister1:children[1]=Lane
```

```JavaScript
> var URIString = encodeURIComponent(mappedString); //get encoded string
```

```URL
> console.log(URIString);
name%3DJohn%26age%3D31%26schools%5B0%5D%3DSchool%20A%26schools%5B1%5D%3DSchool%20B%26schools%5B2%5D%3DSchool%20C%26friends%5B0%5Dname%3DMary%26friends%5B0%5Dage%3D27%26friends%5B1%5Dname%3DSusan%26friends%5B1%5Dage%3D35%26family%3Aparents%5B0%5Drelation%3Dfather%26family%3Aparents%5B0%5Dname%3DDoe%26family%3Aparents%5B1%5Drelation%3Dmother%26family%3Aparents%5B1%5Dname%3DJane%26family%3Asiblings%5B0%5Dsister1%3Aname%3DAna%26family%3Asiblings%5B0%5Dsister1%3Aage%3D26%26family%3Asiblings%5B0%5Dsister1%3Achildren%5B0%5D%3DEric%26family%3Asiblings%5B0%5Dsister1%3Achildren%5B1%5D%3DLane
```

```JavaScript
> var restoredData = mapUriParamsToJSON(URIString, false); //takes encoded/non-encoded string
```


## Notes
The script was not designed to process HTML form data, specifically multi-value variables, i.e. from select attributes. Though if you convert the data to a JSON/JavaScript object, that should work.


Feel free to use it.

Cheers
